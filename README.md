Use the clues from the cells around them, about the number of
neighboring mines in each field.

** Not done - I should still make a landing page for choosing game level, game level is currently set manually in the code by an enum.

# My first git repository
This is a MinesWeeper puzzle game I made for fun. It's the first time I've done such a thing and it was made before I knew how to handle git so I uploaded it manually.

You'll probably see that it is not perfectly planned and organized, made it over a year ago during my first year.
