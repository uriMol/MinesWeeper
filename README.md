# My first git repository
This is a MinesWeeper puzzle game I made for fun. It's the first time I've done such a thing and it was made before I knew how to handle git so I uploaded it manually.

You'll probably see that it is not perfectly planned and organized but it's pretty nice for a first fun after school project.
